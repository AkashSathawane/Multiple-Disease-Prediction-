# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-

The Multiple Disease Prediction project aims to improve the accuracy of machine learning models used for predicting various diseases, with a particular emphasis on recall performance. In healthcare, detecting diseases early is critical to providing effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on evaluating the recall scores of different predictive models, prioritizing those that excel at identifying positive cases and minimizing false negatives.
